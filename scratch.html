                <ul>This website was created from using html, css, and some bootstrap themes from Start Bootstrap. I used a theme called "Clean Blog" and generated the theme for several pages on this website. These sheet however is the only one that was self-created. I designed this one to protray what I have learned about html and css.</ul><br>
            
                <ul>One of my goals is to eventually make it into a race team and being able to use some of the skills I have learned from this class and how we can use information given to us on how to improve the car and help the driver end up winning the race</ul><br>

                <ul id="exp" class="resumelistHeading">The goal of this website is to help display the skills and knowledge I have gained from taking BYU's IS-201 (Introduction to Management Information Systems). This course gave the knowledge on how to use SQL, Better use Microsoft Excel by enabling the ability to use VBA (Visal Basic for Applications). If you go to my porrtolio tab (add a tag to the portfolio tab), you will see I added a excel workbook. However, due to the limited ability of Excel on a browser the Macro Enabled workbook has to be downloaded to you respective computer. But enjoy the opprotunity to play a similar like Wordle game, a number guessing game, a button where what every cell is selected it will give you a row of 1 through 25, and finally a name matching game where you can combine first names and last names.</ul><br>
            
                <ul>As mentioned I have learned how to use SQL (Structured Query Language), html, css, bootstrap, Microsoft Excel, Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, Solver, and Tableau. To get an idea on how I what I learned, please refer to my portfolio page.
